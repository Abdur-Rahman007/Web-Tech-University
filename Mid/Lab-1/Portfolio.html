        <p>
            I am a motivated and inquisitive learner with a deep interest in coding, analytical problem-solving, and ongoing self-development. 
            I perform well in collaborative settings where I can contribute meaningfully while learning from others, and I proactively take on challenges. 
            Recognized for my discipline and commitment, I prefer to lead by example, support those around me, and develop efficient, creative approaches to solving complex technical problems. 
            At present, I am actively exploring AI and machine learning, with the goal of creating impactful solutions through these technologies.
